# Data Census
### Harris School of Public Policy, the University of Chicago

## About
The Harris School of Public Policy has a mission *to develop leaders who put evidence first*. Researching and implementing public policy as a science rooted in data is no easy task. Both facets require collaboration, communication, and a rigorous understanding and standard of data. 

This project aims to facilitate this mission by creating a resource for sharing policy-relevant datasets that have been accumulated, cleaned up, and purchased by researchers around the University Community.
 
This repository has code for:
- A central repository of metadata that may be of interest to the policy research community.
- A collection of code snippets and insights to guide future researchers with obtaining data.
- An onboarding tool for researchers to share their metadata.
