<p>The Nationwide Readmissions Database is designed to support various types of analyses of national readmission rates. The NRD includes discharges for patients with and without repeat hospital visits in a year and those who have died in the hospital. The criteria to determine the relationship between hospital admissions is left to the analyst using the NRD. 
This database was compiled by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), who provides a <a href="https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/db/nation/nrd/nrddde.jsp">Data Dictionary</a> and <a href="https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/db/nation/nrd/nrddbdocumentation.jsp">Full Documentation</a>.</p>
