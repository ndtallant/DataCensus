This [dataset](https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/NCHS-Potentially-Excess-Deaths-from-the-Five-Leadi/vdpk-qzpr) presents information on potentially excess deaths in nonmetropolitan and metropolitan areas at the state level. Potentially excess deaths are defined in MMWR Surveillance Summary 66(No. SS-1):1-8 as deaths that exceed the numbers that would be expected if the death rates of states with the lowest rates (benchmarks) occurred across all states.

This particular dataset has 13 variables/columns and 205,920 rows. Each column is represented by a single field in its SODA API. Using filters and SoQL queries, researcher can search for records, limit results, and adjust the way the data is output

All of the data are aggregated into a CSV or CSV for Excel spreadsheet for easy download. Additional formats for download also include RDF, RSS, TSV for Excel, and XML.

Documentation on the latest version of this dataset provides complete information on variables, data sources, dataset identifier, definitions, and classifications can be found at the API docs [here](https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.cdc.gov/78p9-mpg4)

All communication with the API is done through HTTPS, and errors are communicated through HTTP response codes. Available response types include JSON, XML, and CSV, which are selectable by the "extension" (.json, etc.) on the API endpoint or through content-negotiation with HTTP Accepts headers.
