Since 1968, the U.S. Department of Education (ED) has conducted the Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC) to collect data on key education and civil rights issues in our nation's public schools. The [2013-14 collection](https://usedgov.github.io/api/crdc.html) includes equity data from nearly every public school and public school district in the nation. The following APIs provide access to several CRDC indicators.

An [API key](https://usedgov.github.io/key/) is needed to access to several CRDC indicators.

Three datasets are included -
