The U.S. Department of Education's [My Brotherâ€™s Keeper APIs](https://usedgov.github.io/api/mbk.html) provide access to [several datasets](https://www2.ed.gov/rschstat/statistics/surveys/mbk/index.html) compiled by the My Brother's Keeper Task Force, who gathered indicators from a range of federal data sources to support analyses of important life outcomes for all youth, including boys and young men of color. Specifically, these APIs provide information on 18- to 24-year-olds by race/ethnicity and sex, including high school dropout rates; college enrollment and graduation rates; rates of disconnected youth (who are neither working nor in school); imprisonment rates; and labor force participation rates.

An [API key](https://usedgov.github.io/key/) is needed to access to several CRDC indicators.

Datasets include dozens in indicators on topics such as Environment and Family Structure, Early Care and K-12 Education, Postsecondary Education, Health, Jobs and Earnings, and Criminal Justice and Violent Crime Interaction. Data available for download in XLSX and CSV.
