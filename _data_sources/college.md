This API makes all data available from the Department of Educationâ€™s College Scorecard, as well as supporting data on student completion, debt and repayment, earnings, and more. The files include data from 1996 through 2016 for all undergraduate degree-granting institutions of higher education. Data includes institution level characteristic such as average cost of attendance and retention rates for first-time students, as well as student characteristics such as student body by ethnicity and age. 
The full documentation and data dictionary can be found at [here](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/documentation/).
