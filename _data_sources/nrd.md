The Nationwide Readmissions Database is designed to support various types of analyses of national readmission rates. The NRD includes discharges for patients with and without repeat hospital visits in a year and those who have died in the hospital. The criteria to determine the relationship between hospital admissions is left to the analyst using the NRD.
