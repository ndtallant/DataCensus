The U.S. Energy Information Administration has its data free and open through an API, bulk file download, Excel / Google Sheets add-ons, and pluggable online widgets. EIA's API contains the datasets centered around hourly electricity operations, state energy systems, petroleum products, crude imports, natural gas, coal, international energy, and short-term and annual energy outlook. While the API is offered as a free public service, registration is required. The EIA also provides: 
- [API Terms of Service Agreement](https://www.eia.gov/opendata/register.cfm#terms_of_service)
- [Copyrights and Reuse](https://www.eia.gov/about/copyrights_reuse.cfm)
- [Full Documentation](https://www.eia.gov/opendata/commands.php)
