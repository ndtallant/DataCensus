The current version of the Food Environment Atlas has over 275 variables, including new indicators on access and proximity to a grocery store for sub populations; an indicator on the SNAP Combined Application Project for recipients of Supplemental Security Income (at the State level); and indicators on farmers' markets that report accepting credit cards or report selling baked and prepared food products. All of the data included in the Atlas are aggregated into an Excel spreadsheet for easy download. These data are from a variety of sources and cover varying years and geographic levels. The documentation for each version of the data provides complete information on definitions and data sources, and can be found [here](https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/DataFiles/80526/archived_documentation_August2015.pdf?v=0)
