The MyTSA Web Service API supports several features, some of which include: Security Checkpoint Wait Times, TSA Pre-Check locations, and Sunrise/Sunset times for all locations.
Data can be queried by state and/or airport. The TSA provides XML files of data in addition to the API with [documentation](https://www.dhs.gov/mytsa-api-documentation).
