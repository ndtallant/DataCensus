The Harris School of Public Policy is [commited](https://harris.uchicago.edu/about/who-we-are/our-principles) to cultivating data driven policy makers. We hope to facilitate this goal by creating a resource for sharing policy-relevant datasets that have been accumulated and used by researchers within the University Community.

This project was developed by [Allison Von Borstel](https://github.com/avonborstel) and [Nick Tallant](https://github.com/ndtallant), under the direction of [Jamie Saxon](https://github.com/JamesSaxon) and [Bevis Pardee](https://harris.uchicago.edu/directory/bevis-pardee).
